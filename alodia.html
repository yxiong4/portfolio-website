                <h3> Overview </h3>
                <p> Alodia is a personal finance app designed to makee peer-to-peer transactions and on-the-go budgeting accessible for their users. This app aids users in developing better spending habits and enables them to personalize a budget that best suits their indiviudal lifestyles. </p>

                <h3> Addressing the Problem </h3>
                <p> Over 106 million users in the U.S. are financially insecure and suffer anxiety over their financial situation. Of these users, 32% follow a loose budget, which drops to 26% if the user only has a high-school education or lower. Financial insecurity is an epidemic that doesn't stop within the U.S.; if this is the case, then why don't more personal finance apps incorporate budgeting features to aid their user in developing better spending habits? </p>

                <h3> Identifying the Competition </h3>
                <p> Right off the bat, we wanted to identify our competition, so we performed a competitive analysis. In this analysis, we tried to figure out how our competitors were marketing themselves and pinpoint some of their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for growth. Identifying what our competitors exceed and what they could do better allows us to expand upon good practices and negate harmful ones. </p>

                <p>User personas were created after interviewing a pool of users that best reflect our target audience. From these candidates, we identified core problems and trends, such as 100% of our users have attempted to incorporate a budget into their lifestyle, 90% of our users have fallen off their initial budget plan, and the remaining 10% only loosely follow a budget plan. Based on the data collected during our research, we consolidated and created personas that best reflected our users. </p>

                <h3> Initial ideation </h3>
                <p>After identifying who our users are and their needs, we started the design with a purpose in mind. The initial process began with identifying critical features for our app that align with our user's goals and needs. Issues that manifested during our user research, such as financial insecurity, out-of-control spending habits, etc., were at the forefront of problems we wanted to work on. After determining how to solve these problems best, we fleshed out our core features and created a site map as a framework for our future prototype.</p>

                <h3> Site Map </h3>
                <p> After defining our core features, we developed a site map to lay out the different levels of hierarchy within the Alodia app. Creating a site map allows us an overhead view of what the structure of our app will flow like, as well as how different features will relate to each other. The site map also shows us the bigger picture and differs from user flows. </p>

                <p>Figma was employed to create an interactive prototype of the Alodia app. This prototype allowed us to test the app with our prospective users further and make changes based on their feedback. A usability test was conducted with this prototype to identify issues ranging from low-high before proceeding with development.</p>

                <h3> Usability Test // Results </h3>
                <p> After creating a responsive prototype, we set out to get feedback from the community. After all, the individuals from our community are who we're designing for. We gathered users that fit our target audience and asked them to complete simple tasks on our prototype. Many of them were excited to see the progression of our app and were very active in giving feedback. Points of friction we still needed to identify came to fruition, allowing us to develop our prototype further. </p>

                <p> After consolidating all the feedback from the usability tests, we identified reoccurring friction points throughout our initial prototype. These friction points were analyzed using a matrix to determine if they were a high, medium, or low-priority issue. Categorizing friction points in this way allowed us to resolve high-priority issues before production continued quickly. </p>

                <h3> Final Design </h3>
                <p> Finally, after months of researching, iterating, and user testing, we reached our goal and created a final prototype. The final design encompasses all of the tangible feedback given to us by the community. Collaborating with our users to produce this prototype was informative and gave us a first-hand look into designing with intention. </p>

                <h3> Next Steps </h3>
                <p> Alodia's next steps involve updating the UI of the app to better fit WCAG standards. In addition, other considerations, like a homepage, profile, and setting page, are being developed to expand the prototype and add to the experience. Future testing will be conducted on memorability/users' ability to retain their knowledge. </p>

            <div class="container">
                <h3> Conclusion </h3>
                <p> My biggest takeaway from this project is the importance of user testing and collaboration. Listening to our users' problems and observing them navigate through our system has been very informative, and the feedback they provided was crucial in developing a better product.

                    Getting to know our target audience during the initial user research was also very influential. It allowed us to put a face and a voice to the group of people that I was trying to design for. Ultimately our success was directly linked to the collaborative effort between the community and us.</p>
